# CODSOFT INTERSHIP PROJECTS README

# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for three projects completed as part of the CodSoft Internship:

 Movie Rating System
Sales Prediction
Titanic Survival Prediction
Each project is implemented and executed in Google Colab for ease of use and accessibility.

Project Descriptions
# 1.  Movie Rating System
This project involves building a system that predicts movie ratings based on various features such as user demographics, movie genre, and past ratings.

# 2. Sales Prediction
In this project, we aim to predict future sales based on historical sales data, considering various factors like seasonal trends, promotional campaigns, and economic indicators.

# 3. Titanic Survival Prediction
This classic machine learning project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

Running the Projects
Prerequisites
Before running any of the projects, ensure you have the following:

A Google account to access Google Colab
Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning
Steps to Run the Projects
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine or directly access the files in Google Colab.

bash Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codsoft-internship-projects.git

2. Open Google Colab
Go to Google Colab and sign in with your Google account.

3. Upload the Notebooks
Upload the respective Jupyter notebooks for each project to your Google Colab environment.

4. Run the Notebooks
Movie Rating System

Open the Movie_Rating_System.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.
Sales Prediction

Open the Sales_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.
Titanic Survival Prediction

Open the Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.
Dependencies
Each notebook includes the necessary library installations in the first few cells. The main libraries used across these projects are:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Ensure you run these cells to install the required libraries.
